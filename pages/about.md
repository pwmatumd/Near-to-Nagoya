## About the Collection

When I went to Japan in 2019, I only expected to be there for 8 months. When Covid-19 hit, I decided to stay in Japan and ended up there until April 2022. During my time in Japan I had the opportunity to try many unique, exciting, and historic experiences. My weekends were always full of journeys to new and favorite places. Here on this website I've collected photos of various locales I enjoyed, along with memories, folklore, and history I learned at each of them. Each page offers a representative image of these places, ones which I want to remember for many years down the line. 

In order to remember them, I've chronicled them here while the experiences are fresh in my memory. Welcome to the library of my time in Japan!
