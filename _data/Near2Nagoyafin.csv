nag001,Korankei.jpg,Korankei,"Korankei Gorge, Asuke",Toyota,Aichi,"Nature, Temple/Shrine","One of my favorite places to visit in any season. The small town nearby is so much fun to wander through. Gohei mochi and soba are always a must here at the local folk craft village. Many of the maples there today were planted in 1634 by the abbot of Kojaku-ji. At the top of the mountain is a small rock, where the god of healthy feet used to stand on one foot, until he was moved to the bottom of the mountain and a bigger shrine. Nearby is a great example of a rebuilt Sengoku era castle. This was great because it let me visualize what the many destroyed mountain castles I encountered looked like.

There was a lot of comfort for me getting to see Ontake-san everyday. I tried climbing it once in the fall, but a huge snowstorm forced me to turn back halfway up. The second time I went in the summer and was able to make it to the top. On the way I walked a bit with a couple of Ontake-san worshippers, I was really happy to be able to walk with them in mutual appreciation of the mountain and the god on it. The mixed scents of pine and sulfur still stay strong in my memory.

Having prayed at various shrines dedicated to her throughout the country, it felt much more intimate to be able to worship her here. The approach to the shrine is a really wonderful one as it winds through a grove of many trees. The act of rebuilding the shrine every 20 years having been repeated here for hundreds of years makes for a point of deep rumination for me about the cyclical nature of our existence.

The way it mimics the Heian era courts' buildings is a thrilling step back into time. Behind it is a fantastic garden with a beautiful bridge. When I was here I fed the koi in the pond and it was a lot of fun.

I remember on night I was able to sit for an hour alone with the work besides for a couple of deer nearby. Nara at night is really special and the time where I could feel like I was truly in touch with all the powers that reside there. This statue is a whopping 27.5 feet tall and was built in 1203. They are made up of various smaller blocks of wood that were carved then assembled together like a puzzle. Nio (Agyo and Ungyo) were followers of the Buddha who would use force to protect him.

Larger than Tokyo Disneyland in size, building from all over Japan have been collected here to represent the fascinating Meiji Period(1868-1912). The style of buildings are a mix of Western and Eastern styles and tell stories of transition through their structure. Seeing them all gathered here is such a thrill. In this picture are the Tokyo Central Station Police Box in front of the Kanazawa Prison Central Guard Station. One of the cool things about this place is that nearly every building has been featured in the Golden Kamuy manga. There was even one day where they turned the whole museum into a Golden Kamuy real escape game. It took us all day to solve it, but we managed! Also met a whole lot of elderly woman wearing the same shirt as me that day and got to have some nice chats about Golden Kamuy.

Summer nights were spent doing fireworks on the bank, swimming with the fish, and watching the ukai fishermen. Watching the fishing was a transportative moment that felt pulled right from the Edo period, it was one of those moments that really just sticks with you. There are also loads of cherry blossom trees nearby and we would go there every year to take them in. One of the trees has been foretelling how good the yearly catch will be for about 500 years based on how many flowers it has. In the winter we got to watch boats with large numbered lanterns float down the river in celebration of the New Year.

In this picture, Masumida Jinja is decorated for the celebrations. The reason the Tanabata festival is so popular here is the city's history as a hub of weaving, which ties in closely to the story and the weaving woman in it. I would bike to this shrine fairly often or stop by and say hello to the kami when coming back from the train station. The kami who resides here is Amenoho no Akari no mikoto, a kami of the sun and agriculture who makes the rice ripen and become red. Around New Year's a bugaku dance was held within the shrine which I got to sit in on. The controlled movements always leave me impressed. There was also a large boat filled with vegetables. One of my favorite monks also has a tie to the place, Kukai. It goes like this: There was a large drought, so Kukai built a straw dragon and breathed life into it. When asked to make rain the dragon said he couldn't because if he did he would die, since all other dragons had banned him from doing so. Kukai said if he made rain he would be enshrined at the jinja after his death. The dragon agreed and is now worshipped at the shrine.

The streets are like a maze and invite just wandering around, because at literally every corner there is a cute little detail to invite awe and appreciation. There are also many stray cats that wander around and are quite friendly. The climbing kilns are aesthetically pleasing and also quite a practical use of the confined area. Outside of the main stretch of town there is a little place called Mentai Park, dedicated to that tasty egg, mentaiko. Watching the eggs be processed is a little weird, due to the many egg sacs just flopping around.

Behind the museum are some rebuilt kofun to model what they would have looked like when built. The picture here shows the rebuilt one with many haniwa standing around all sides. The museum itself is very concise and had some clear information in English and a really well put together walking tour of the neighborhoods. A real highlight though was an augmented reality game that could be downloaded to my phone. This game had a cute little story where you help the museum's mascots (a haniwa and princess) defeated an ancient evil that is corrupting local haniway. It required going to different spots, catching various forms of haniwa, and learning about the kofun. It also had a cool capability to overlay images on the landscape to see what it looked like in the past. The final battle took place at the Shiratorizuka, where the swan that had carried Yamato Takeru after his bite was supposedly buried.

There is even a little mound where the placenta is buried from his birth. This was a common practice during that time because they were believed to be linked to the child's destiny. The castle itself is pretty standard for rebuilt ones, but the museum there is very good, just a lot of reading. One of my fondest memories there is eating dango as big as my head while sitting next to the moat during a sakura festival. The whole castle and area by the river was decorated for the blossoms. I also got to have some outstanding inarizushi while there. Nearby is also a hatcho miso factory. It's called hatcho because that is how far it was from the castle when invented. This type of red miso is one of Nagoya's, if not its most famous, products. And I can say why, I love this type of miso the most for its earthy richness and appeasing color.

The main building is tucked away in a little vale with running water running through it. Tado holds a special place in my heart because Sean and I would bike here from Ichinomiya along the Kiso River. It was a chance for us to blow off steam from work and just hang out. There is a little takoyaki window in a family house near the shrine that we would always stop at for their tasty treats. We also would often hike up into the mountain along a little road and one time heard a frog that sounded like a stereo. There was also a spot in the river where we could swim around and cool off. Next to it was a beautiful waterfall that seemed to descend straight from the sky. At the foot of it were often offerings of daikon and sake. We usually came here in summer, so the sound of cicadas and the huge clouds rising up often remind me of our journeys.

nag013,Ooricho.jpg,Ooricho,Man Demon Village,Hikone,Shiga,History,"Lyric suggested this place and it ended up being an unbelievably memorable day. Many towns in the mountains have become abandoned in recent years and this town,Ooricho, is one of them that was recommended by his professor as a place worth visiting. And it was. We hiked up from a station in the middle of a field along some poor roads that wound along the mountainside. On our way up we came across some birders who were very friendly. Right before reaching the village we saw what was probably a tanuki which made my day, thos adorable little rascals. We also saw a badger and a monkey skull later on. The village was filled with many thatch roofed houses like the one in this picture. A house like that is my dream house. From the village we had to hike up quite a bit to reach a jinja dedicated to Izanagi which is still actively used and upkept today despite its difficulty to reach. During this time I was struggling with whether or not to stay in Japan, and it was at this shrine that I was able to gain some clarity and decide to stay. Another memorable moment was when we discovered that I had been bitten by a leech and that leeches live in the woods in Japan. I ended up bleeding for three hours thanks to the little sucker, but boy was it memorable. We ended up walking about 12 miles that day due to a lack of buses on our way back down.

Most of the current buildings date from 1642 when they were rebuilt after the Battle of Sekigahara. The kami enshrined here is Kanayama-hiko-no-mikoto, the kami of mining and metalworking. This shrine is pretty cool and made for a nice half day trip when I didn't feel like going too far. In the shrine precinct are loads of metal tools on plaques that worshippers have given in thanks. Behind the shrine is a nice hike to a view where some armies had waited before the Battle of Sekigahara. From the top it's possible to see a large amount of the Owari Plain and even Ichinomiya.

nag015,YoronoTaki.jpg,Yoro no Taki,Yoro Falls,Yoro,Gifu,"History, Nature","Yoro Falls is a famous waterfall due to the following story. A n old man and his son were surviving by cutting wood and selling it. Eventually, the old man couldn't cut anymore, so his son had to work even harder. One day when he was out in the woods he came across a waterfall that was spilling forth sake. He knew his dad loved sake, so he filled the gourd and brought it to him every day. Eventually the emperor heard of this and came for a visit. The story of filial piety is well remembered and everything in the area seems to have a gourd on it as merchandising. I got a nice pair of black chopsticks with the gourd on them from the ticket booth at Yoro Park, a funky park where the ground slopes and everything is meant to be explored. It's basically an art park where nothing is off limits. I remember hiking to the top of the mountain one time and you could see all the way to Shiga, even through the misty clouds blowing around me.

Before the shinbutsu bunri(separation of Shinto and Buddhism) in the Meiji Period, this was a common practice everywhere. Yet even when the edict was passed, many places of worship just changed the names of buildings without changing their use. This temple is neat because it has the classic temple approach with many shops lining both sides of the road. There were loads of inarizushi places that were just fantastic with all sorts of flavors. I enjoyed this temple a lot because of how the statues were all in the back, where a wooded forest stood, right in the middle of the city!

They're neat, but I prefer the cold hardwood floor ones where you have to take your shoes off. The approach to it is rather cool though, making use of the naturally hilly landscape for defenses. There is a story here about a Yamauchi Chiyo, who spent all her money on a wonderful horse that led to her husband, Yamauchi Kazutoyo's promotion. She is often regarded as the reason for her husband's success. A surprising connection I found when traveling was that Kazutoyo built Kochi castle. It's amazing to me how much cross over there is with people over hundreds of miles. In the town below I had an outstanding meal of Gujo miso hotpot with all sorts of fresh veggies. Hotpots are really fantastic. There is a very beautiful and whimsical art museum of Masao Mizuno's works. He often draws woodland critters doing cute things.

I have had so much fun here biking around. There is a great bike map that leads to many of the spots where armies were located and gives a really experiential learning opportunity. The museum here is also very informative and lets you pose like a warlord and showcases the unique differences between eastern and western Japan, like how they make their rice balls or how holidays are celebrated. It also has stuff not related to the battle and I fondly remember going into the cave with Miguel and being surprised by bats, and then exploring the old WWII era bunkers. Tucked away is also a rock where Takeru no Mikoto sat. There are a surprising amount of locations in Japan that are remembered as being spots where people sit, and I enjoyed getting to sit on them.

When I first came here, it was a rushed trip and kind of soggy, but when I snagged this picture it was a total blast. I came with Lyric, Miguel, his mom, and Camilo. We all just had so much fun, like building a snowman then using bottle caps and leaves to decorate him, and eating delicious soup.

Ibuki is another of my favorite mountains in Japan and one I often marveled at from Ichinomiya. It helped to ground me when I felt stressed, to be able to look and see its always changing appearance with the weather and time of day. It's a great day hike climb with varied terrain and awesome views from the top. There is also loads of mythology going on with it, which I am just in love with. 1.The oni leader, Shuten Doji, made his lair in a rocky craggy area near the top. 2. The mountain god wanted to be the tallest in the area, so he chopped all the other mountains down to be smaller than him. 3. Yamato Takeru once tried climbing it to kill the god. As he climbed he saw a white boar which he shot at, but decided to let live since he thought it was just a messenger. Turned out it was the god. As he climbed the weather got much worse and forced him to turn back, and as he did he got bit by a snake. This led to him dying.
